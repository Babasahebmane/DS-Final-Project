# DS-Final-Project
•The objective of a project on customer personality analysis using unsupervised learning would be to develop and implement a machine learning model that can uncover hidden insights and patterns in customer behavior data. 

• The goal of the project would be to use this model to better understand customer personalities and preferences. This could involve training the model on a large dataset of customer behavior 
data, using techniques like clustering or dimensionality reduction to identify patterns and trends in the data. 

• In this project mainly, I was working on Clusters. Project is that like what kind of customers are present. Also work on EDA, Feature Engineering and Deployment by using streamlit.
